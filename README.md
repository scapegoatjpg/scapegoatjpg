# I _am _Scapegoat 🐐🐕 (she/her)♀️
But you can call me Laura 👋
I go by scapegoat.exe but that profile name was already taken smh 😠

Welcome to my personal GitHub account, I have another account that's mostly for more *personal* personal projects, but I'm going to get back into posting on this account. I talk a little bit about myself on my [website](lauralongoria.netlify.app/) if you wish to check it out. Here's a few things I plan to work on/am working on now (listed by priority):
- Pixel styled Fantasy RPG 
- An app *that's all I'm willing to share*
- Facial Recognition Profiled Smart Mirror
- Personal Home Server



Currently, I am a high school Computer Science teacher at Klein Oak High School, so I am getting used to managing class time and planning along with my personal life and projects that I wish to work on. More specifically, I teach Computer Science 1, 2, and 3, along with AP Computer Science Principles and Foundations of Cybersecurity.

Along with my projects and work, I plan to start a YouTube channel that will document my progress with my projects and educational videos on CS basics. Though, I'm not sure when I'm going to implement this, but I do plan to soon.

I'll add on more onto this uwu
