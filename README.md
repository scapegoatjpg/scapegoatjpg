Welcome to my personal GitHub account, I have another account that's mostly for more *personal* personal projects, but I'm going to get back into posting on this account. I talk a little bit about myself on my [website](lauralongoria.netlify.app/) if you wish to check it out. I'm working on personal projects which I will soon post later on. I'm planning to work on a smart mirror with personal perference profiles based on facial recognition, and I'm going to be working on creating video games with a few of my friends.


Currently, I am a high school AP Computer Science teacher at Heights High School, so I am getting used to managing class time and planning along with my personal life and projects that I wish to work on. I specifically only teach AP Computer Science Principles for now, but I have informed that I will be able to teach more advanced classes for students who are interested. 

I'll add one more onto this uwu
